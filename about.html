<h1>About Me</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    I am a Machine Learning Systems Engineer and researcher working on the design,
    optimization, and governance of large-scale AI systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    My background spans NLP, Generative AI, distributed ML, and GPU-accelerated systems.
    I am currently pursuing research in responsible and human-centered AI with a focus
    on healthcare and long-term system reliability.

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe modern AI progress is constrained not by models, but by systems:
    memory hierarchies, communication, inference orchestration, and alignment constraints.
  </p>

<h2>Contact & Collaboration</h2>

<p>
  I am open to research and engineering collaborations in
  ML systems, LLM infrastructure, distributed learning,
  and high-performance AI computing.
