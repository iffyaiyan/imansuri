<h1>Projects (ML Systems Focus)</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    My projects emphasize system-level challenges in modern machine learning,
    memory movement, parallelism, communication overhead, and lifecycle control,
    rather than isolated model performance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GPU-Optimized LLM Inference Systems</strong><br/>
      Designed and analyzed inference pipelines focusing on KV-cache management,
      memory-aware batching, attention optimization, and latency–throughput trade-offs.
      Explored how inference bottlenecks shift from compute to memory bandwidth
      as model and context sizes scale.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Federated Learning Systems with Communication Compression</strong><br/>
      Built FL pipelines integrating gradient compression, quantization,
      and sparsity techniques to reduce communication overhead.
      Focused on system-level trade-offs between accuracy, bandwidth,
      synchronization cost, and GPU utilization.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>LLM Unlearning Frameworks</strong><br/>
      Research and prototyping of machine unlearning techniques for large models,
      addressing selective forgetting, regulatory compliance, and
      system-level guarantees without full retraining.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>High-Performance Distributed Training Pipelines</strong><br/>
      Designed multi-GPU and multi-node training workflows with attention to
      data parallelism, model parallelism, memory hierarchy, and interconnect efficiency.
      Benchmarked scaling behavior and failure modes in HPC-style environments.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Agentic ML Systems & RAG Architectures</strong><br/>
      Built multi-agent systems with planning, reflection, and tool execution,
      emphasizing system orchestration, context management,
      and failure-aware execution loops rather than prompt engineering alone.
    </li>
  </ul>
