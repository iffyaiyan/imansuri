<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    My research focuses on re-framing modern ML challenges as
    <strong>systems problems</strong>; where memory, communication,
    compute orchestration, and governance dominate performance and reliability.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>LLM Unlearning & Model Lifecycle Control</strong><br/>
      Studying selective forgetting mechanisms, unlearning guarantees,
      and system-level validation for compliance-driven AI systems.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>ML Systems for LLM Inference</strong><br/>
      KV-cache management, attention memory optimization,
      batching strategies, and inference-time scheduling.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Federated & Distributed Learning Systems</strong><br/>
      Communication-efficient training, robustness under partial participation,
      and scaling behavior across heterogeneous devices.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>High-Performance Computing for AI</strong><br/>
      GPU memory hierarchy, parallel computation models,
      and performance bottlenecks in large-scale training and inference.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Responsible & Human-Centric AI Systems</strong><br/>
      Bridging systems design with accountability, privacy,
      and long-term societal impact.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Open Collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    I am actively interested in collaborations at the intersection of
    ML systems research and real-world deployment;
    particularly where theory meets operational constraints.
